Provides a series of essential ES Module demos from "Hello World" to more involved examples of using the
[TyphonJS Runtime Library](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/runtime) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) on
[Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

## About:
Getting started with a new library or development methodology can be difficult. This demo module
provides the essentials with working with Svelte and various aspects that are provided with the TyphonJS Runtime
Library. Please stop by the [![TyphonJS Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/737953117999726592?label=TyphonJS)](https://discord.gg/mnbgN8f)
Discord server to ask any questions.

## Installation (Requires Foundry VTT version 10):
1. Fork this repo or better yet directly clone this repo following step two below. This repo is a demo repo, so use
[template-svelte-esm](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo/template-svelte-esm) to create your own new TRL based
module.
2. Use WebStorm or VSCode to clone this repo into the Foundry VTT data / modules directory (make sure to keep the name
`essential-svelte-esm` as the folder installed in your module directory as this is the `name` used in `module.json`).
3. Open in your IDE and proceed to run `npm install`
4. Run the NPM script `build` to create the production bundle or `dev` to run in developer mode which uses `esbuild` &
HMR (hot module replacement) to dynamically update your running module in real time for all Svelte related components.
5. Restart Foundry VTT. This is necessary for Foundry to load the new module.
6. You should now have a new module installed `Essential Svelte (ESM)` visible in your modules list.
7. Launch a game / world of your choice.
8. Enable `Essential Svelte (ESM)` under `Manage Modules`.
9. On reload the Essential Svelte menu app appears next to the Foundry sidebar. Click the buttons to launch various
demos.

## Direct Foundry Install Link:
You may also install this demo module directly with the following link by pasting it into `manifest URL` field in the
`add-on modules / install module` screen:

## What Is Happening Here?
Presently there are two demo examples. The first is the "Hello Foundry / World" example:
- The message input box is bound to the top title. Type in a new message to see it dynamically update the title from
`Hello Foundry`.
- Clicking on the `Launch a modal dialog` button shows off the really neat modal dialog capability of TRL. This creates
a dialog using a "glasspane" approach that prevents users from interacting with the rest of the Foundry UI without
causing Foundry itself to pause. (`TJSDialog.prompt`)
- The checkboxes for `draggable`, `minimizable` and `resizable` show a few of the reactive Application options that
can be dynamically changed during runtime. If you click off 'draggable' the application window is no longer draggable;
likewise turn off minimizable prevents the window from being minimized when clicking the title bar. Clicking off
resizable dynamically turns off the resize capability of the window. There are several additional standard application
options that are reactive with TRL application shells.
- At the bottom are a couple of resources for you to start your learning adventure about Svelte. The interactive Svelte
tutorial is highly recommended and well put together and goes through the core concepts of working with Svelte that you
can apply to your usage of TRL.

The second example shows the reactive positional capabilities of TRL:
- An application with the positional data shown is launched along with a dialog that allows control of the application
launched. The dialog will appear over top of the application, so move the dialog to the side. You can proceed to control
the application through sliders in the dialog along with various save / restore buttons w/ animation at the bottom of
the dialog.

## About the TyphonJS Runtime Library:
The TyphonJS Runtime Library (TRL) brings an exciting new library resource for all Foundry VTT developers to build
advanced modules and game systems using Svelte. A Svelte UI component library built for Foundry and extensions to the
core Foundry UI / Application framework make it easy to create declarative Svelte based UIs in a method familiar to
Foundry VTT developers. The core UI component framework contains reactive "application shells" that provide an enhanced
ability to control your UI / window experience including intro and outro transitions along with support key UI elements
like context menus and a new backward compatible and API compliant Dialog component that features a modal dialog option.
